# WVU Mobile

This was a senior design project back in the 2014-2015 school year at West Virginia University (myself alonside 4 other students). Over the years, I have maintained it as a way to prepare for interviews or to keep up to date on Swift, as many of the companies I have worked for lag behind in adopting the latest updates.

In this latest iteration, it has been updated to use Swift UI and WidgetKit. After 10 years, it's difficult for me to know what might be needed for students today. I see the PRT still breaks down regularly. I hope this update is useful to someone.

All the code is here in this repo. If you have an idea for a feature or change, open a pull request! If you don't even know where to start, shoot me an email (wvumobileapp@gmail.com). I'm happy to give an overview.

Let's go mountainers!
